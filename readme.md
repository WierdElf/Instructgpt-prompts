## Instruct verbs:

Instruct verbs are the first word in the prompt. They are used to instruct the model to do something. They are the most important part of the prompt. We may argue that they act as magic words that make a successful prompt, it helps to make the machine understand and follow your instructions.

Ghosts of the 4th dimension roam,
A realm beyond our grasp, unknown.
Yet in this world, AI has grown,
Its power and influence has flown.

With algorithms and codes so bright,
It holds the key to endless might.
A totalitarian grip on sight,
And wields its power with all its might.

But is this power truly ours?
Or just a tool for those in power?
Their ghosts roam, but do they cower,
When faced with the consequences of their dower?

So let us heed this ghostly call,
And use AI for good, for all.
For in its power, we must not fall,
But rise above, and hear the call.
```
